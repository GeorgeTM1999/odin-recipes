        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>An incredibly moist, rich, triple-layer, perfect chocolate cake with whipped cream filling and chocolate buttercream frosting. This was always a favorite in our house! You can garnish the cake with sprinkles, chocolate curls, or seasonal fresh fruit.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       
        <h3>Cake:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 cups boiling water</li>
            <li>2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Frosting:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pint heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Start cake: Place cocoa in a medium bowl. Gently pour boiling water over top and stir to combine; let cool, about 15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
          <li>Sift together flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder into a mixing bowl.</li>
          <li>Combine sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in vanilla. Add flour mixture alternately with the cooled cocoa mixture, mixing only until combined. Pour 1/3 of the cake batter into each of the prepared pans, spreading evenly.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean and cakes pull away from the sides of the pans, 18 to 22 minutes. Remove cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert cakes carefully onto the wire rack and let cool completely, about 20 more minutes.</li>
          <li>While the cakes are cooling, make frosting and filling: Beat butter for frosting in a mixing bowl until creamy. Gradually mix in confectioners' sugar, cocoa, and vanilla; continue to mix until light and fluffy, 7 to 10 minutes. Set aside.</li>
          <li>Make filling: Whip heavy cream and vanilla in a bowl until cream becomes thick. Add confectioners' sugar and continue to whip until stiff but not too grainy.</li>
          <li>Fill and frost cake: Remove cooled cake layers from pans. Trim any top surfaces to make them flat. Place one layer on a nice plate and spread 1/3 of the filling over the top. Top with another layer and another 1/2 of the remaining filling. Place the remaining cake layer on top. Spread frosting around the sides of the layers, leaving a ridge that extends up over the top edge. Spread the remaining filling over the top of the cake, inside the ridge of frosting.</li>
        </ol>
